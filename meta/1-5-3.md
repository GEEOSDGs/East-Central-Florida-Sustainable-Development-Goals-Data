**Revised indicator:** Revised to the local context from original text: "Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030."

**Non-Statistical Indicator**

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has several risk reduction policies including [Coastal Construction Manuals](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1510-20490-2899/fema55_voli_combined.pdf) and [Hazard Mitigation Assistance Guidance](https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/hazard-mitigation-assistance-guidance). The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services has a California State [Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://www.caloes.ca.gov/cal-oes-divisions/hazard-mitigation/hazard-mitigation-planning/state-hazard-mitigation-plan).
