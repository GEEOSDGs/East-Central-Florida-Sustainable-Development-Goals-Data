## Relevant Policies

Extensive protections for LGBTQIA+ people exist under California State law. In 2000, California [Assembly Bill 1001](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=199920000AB1001) reformed the California Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1959 and broadened employment, housing, and credit protections for gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals. In 2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law [Assembly Bill 1400](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200520060AB1400), the Civil Rights Act of 2005, ensuring that state laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations include gender identity, sexual orientation and marital status. [Article 16](http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2018/18-0086_ORD_186084_06-09-2019.pdf) entitled “Civil and Human Rights Law” of
Chapter IV of the Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibits discrimination against another person in private
employment, housing, education or commerce, because of that person’s actual or
perceived race, color, ethnicity, creed, age, national origin, religion, citizenship status,
gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition,
genetic information, marital status, partnership status, employment status, income
status, military status or veteran status.
