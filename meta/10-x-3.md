## Relevant Policies

The [Gender Recognition Act of 2017 (SB179)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB179) allows transgender, intersex and nonbinary people to obtain state-issued identity documents that accurately reflect their gender identity, making California the first state to not require people to officially identify as “male” or “female.”
