## Relevant Policies

Los Angeles City Planning holds regular public hearings and commission meetings, offering opportunities for public engagement on a variety of policy and project considerations at the city level. In addition to local board meetings, there are nine citizen-led commissions that contribute to citywide discussions on planning and land use. The commissions meet regularly to give advice and make recommendations on planning-related matters: the City Planning Commission, the Cultural Heritage Commission, and seven Area Planning Commissions.
