**Alternative Data Indicator Source**

The [City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs](https://culturela.org/) has created a [Neighborhood Arts Profile](http://neighborhoodartsprofile.org/youth-arts-profile/); data-informed visualizations of the City’s arts and cultural infrastructure to help increase the region’s understanding of existing service gaps that impede the overall health of the community.  The resulting data visualizations aggregate and map Los Angeles arts and cultural infrastructure, providing a data-informed understanding of the City’s entire cultural ecosystem.  The data sets are noted [here](http://neighborhoodartsprofile.org/research/data/) and accessible via the City's open data portal.
