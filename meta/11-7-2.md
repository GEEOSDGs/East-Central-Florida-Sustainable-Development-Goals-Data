  In 2012, the Department of Justice announced revisions to its definition of
  rape, which had not been updated since 1929. The revised, federally recognized
  definition of rape makes the crime gender neutral (previously, men were
  excluded from being victims); either gender can be victim or perpetrator. The
  new definition also includes instances of rape with an object, as well as
  instances in which the victim is incapable of giving consent because of
  temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity, including due to the
  influence of drugs or alcohol. Part I Violent Crimes include homocide (110),
  manslaughter (113), rape (121), attempted rape (122), sexual penetration w/
  foreign object (815), oral copulation (820), sodomy (821), robbery (210),
  attempted robery (220), ADW (230), ADW against LAPD police officer (213),
  child beating (235), spousal beating (236), shots fired (250), shots fired
  inhabited dwelling (251), brandishing (761), train wrecking (926).
