**Revised indicator:**
This indicator has been revised to the local level from the original text: "Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies"

**Non-Statistical Indicator**

Los Angeles was selected as an inaugural member of the 100 Resilient Cities Network in 2013. Since then, Angelenos have come together to develop Resilient Los Angeles, a strategy by and for Angelenos that leverages the city’s strengths and advances new partnerships in order to prepare Los Angeles to address current and future challenges.
