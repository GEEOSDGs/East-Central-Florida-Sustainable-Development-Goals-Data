## Relevant Policies

In 2015, the Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released the first Sustainability City pLAn, committing to annual progress reports and a major update to the pLAn every four years. [L.A.’s Green New Deal](https://plan.lamayor.org/targets/targets_plan.html) is an expanded vision for the pLAn—securing clean air and water and a stable climate, improving community resilience, expanding access to healthy food and open space, and promoting justice for all—and for the future we have to build on behalf of our children and grandchildren. The Green New Deal outlines specific targets realted to sustainable consumption and production.
