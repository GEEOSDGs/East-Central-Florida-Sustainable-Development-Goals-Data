## Relevant Policies

L.A.’s Green New Deal is an expanded vision for the [City's Sustainability pLAn](https://plan.lamayor.org/) — securing clean air and water and a stable climate, improving community resilience, expanding access to healthy food and open space, and promoting justice for all—and for the future we have to build on behalf of our children and grandchildren. The Green New Deal has action plans related to sustainable public procurement in the following areas: 

1) Update City procurement and contracting requirements to include specifications on surplus food recovery, styrofoam, and single-use plastic

2) Ensure that 100% of the City’s new light duty purchases are electric 

3) Ensure that 100% of new vehicles for the Meals on Wheels program are electric 

4) Update the City’s Environmentally Preferred Products Purchasing Program to include additional construction materials and a GHG performance standard, such as the Buy Clean California Act 

5) Further identify embedded carbon emissions in the City’s supply chain through Departmental participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project supply chain reporting program
