## Relevant Policies

Public education in Los Angeles is governed by the State of California Department of Education. To receive a high school diploma, the [State-mandated graduation course requirements](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/gs/hs/cefhsgradreq.asp) include three years of social science education, including world history, culture, and geography. 
The State State Board of Education adopted the [History-Social Science Framework](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/hs/cf/hssframework.asp) for public education. The grade ten curriculum on "World History, Culture, and Geography: The Modern World" includes a standard that students "should be able to identify a range of issues—including sustainable development—that could be described as 'transnational' in
scope."
