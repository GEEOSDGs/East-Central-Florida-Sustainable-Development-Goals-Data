**Revised indicator:**
This indicator has been revised to the local level from the original text: "Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030"

**Non-Statistical Indicator**

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has several risk reduction policies including Coastal Construction Manuals and Flood Minitagion Program Guidelines. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services has a California State Hazard Mitigation Plan.
