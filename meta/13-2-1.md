## Relevant Policies
In 2015, the Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released the first Sustainability City pLAn, committing to annual progress reports and a major update to the pLAn every four years. [L.A.’s Green New Deal](https://plan.lamayor.org/targets/targets_plan.html) is an expanded vision for the pLAn—securing clean air and water and a stable climate, improving community resilience, expanding access to healthy food and open space, and promoting justice for all—and for the future we have to build on behalf of our children and grandchildren. The Green New Deal outlines ambitious local targets including the fize zeros of zero carbon grid, zero carbon transportation, zero carbon buildings, zero waste, and zero wasted water by 2025. 

Policies that increase resilience – climate adaptation, infrastructure modernization, and economic security – are integrated throughout the Green New Deal. Together, the [L.A. Green New Deal](https://plan.lamayor.org/targets/targets_plan.html), the [2018 Resilient Los Angeles](https://www.lamayor.org/sites/g/files/wph446/f/page/file/Resilient%20Los%20Angeles.pdf) strategy, and the 2018 updated [Local Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://emergency.lacity.org/sites/g/files/wph496/f/2018_LA_HMP_Final_2018-11-30.pdf) encompass L.A.’s approach to protecting the most vulnerable Angelenos from climate change shocks and stressors.
