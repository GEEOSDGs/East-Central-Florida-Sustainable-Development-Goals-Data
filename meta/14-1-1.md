  The Beach Report Card (BRC) by Heal the Bay has provided beachgoers with
  reliable and easy-to-understand information about water quality at the beach
  for the last 25 years. The BRC collects shoreline monitoring data from
  government agencies and issues grades for beaches across California, Oregon,
  and Washington. The better the grade a beach receives, the lower the risk of
  illness to beachgoers. The Beach Report Card Score is calculated by using
  shoreline monitoring data on contaminants like Enterococcus and Fecal
  Coliform. A full methodology can be found in Appendix D of the 2018-2019 Beach
  Report Card report
  (https://healthebay.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BRC_2019_FINAL2.pdf).

The City of Los Angeles has installed approximately 30,000 screens and another 10,000 inserts in the catch basins throughout the five watersheds that the City discharges into. That, coupled with institutional measures that we conduct routinely like street sweeping, outreach/education, source control investigation, enforcement, etc, minimizes the amount of trash that outflows into watersheds and the ocean. Trash found in the receiving waters may stem from other sources like wind blown trash during dry weather conditions, illegal dumping, etc.
