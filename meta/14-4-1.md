  The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
  measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by their
  abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level,
  that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as
  biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY
  level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.

target: >-
  By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal,
  unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and
  implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in
  the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum
  sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics

**Not Applicable in the local context**

Local governments do not have jurisdiction over marine areas and therefore cannot pass regulations on sustainable fisheries. In California, the tidelands up to 3 nautical miles from shore are managed by the [California State Lands Commission](https://www.slc.ca.gov/water-boundaries/). The Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone and, Exclusive Economic Zone are regulated by the [federal government](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/us-maritime-limits-and-boundaries.html#general-information). The [Magnuson-Stevens Act](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/magnuson-stevens-fishery-conservation-and-management-act) is the primary law governing marine fisheries management in U.S. federal waters.
