**Not Applicable in the local context**

Local governments do not have jurisdiction over marine areas and therefore cannot pass regulations on sustainable fisheries. In California, the tidelands up to 3 nautical miles from shore are managed by the [California State Lands Commission](https://www.slc.ca.gov/water-boundaries/). The Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone and, Exclusive Economic Zone are regulated by the [federal government](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/us-maritime-limits-and-boundaries.html#general-information). The [Magnuson-Stevens Act](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/magnuson-stevens-fishery-conservation-and-management-act) is the primary law governing marine fisheries management in U.S. federal waters.
