**Non-Statistical Indicator**

Over 20% of the land area in the City of Los Angeles is designated Open Space in the [General Plan](https://planning.lacity.org/plans-policies/general-plan-overview). Open Space is land which is essentially free of structures and buildings and/or natural in character and functions. The Santa Monica Mountains and Griffith Park compose 30% of this open space area. 

The City of Los Angeles has approximately 6 million trees. Approximately 63 square miles (or 15% of the city total area) is zoned for Open Space which includes parts of the Santa Monica Mountains and Griffith Park. L.A.'s Green New Deal outlines two milestones to plant and maintain at least 90,000 trees and complete a citywide tree inventory by 2021.
