## Relevant Policies
The [City of Los Angeles' Green New Deal](https://plan.lamayor.org/sites/default/files/pLAn_2019_final.pdf) has a target to "increase tree canopy in areas of greatest need by at least 50% by 2028 to grow a more equitable urban forest that provides cooling, public health, habitat, energy savings, and other benefits." One of the milestones for this target is to complete a citywide tree inventory by 2021; and an Urban Forest Management Plan by 2025. In 2019, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti named Rachel Malarich as [City Forest Officer](https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-names-rachel-malarich-la%E2%80%99s-first-ever-city-forest-officer) — a new post created to oversee the growth of Los Angeles’ urban forest and help the City reach its goal to plant 90,000 trees by 2021.
