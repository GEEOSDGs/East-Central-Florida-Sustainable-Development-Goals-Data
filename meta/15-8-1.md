## Relevant Policies

The [California Department of Fish and Wildlife](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Invasives/Regulations) has several laws and regulations in place regarding invasive species. Many relate to the management of aquatic invasive species including the [Fish and Game Code (FGC) ยง 2300 - 2302](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=FGC&division=3.&title=&part=&chapter=3.5.&article=). 

The [California Department of Food and Agriculture](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/invasives/) also has guidelines on the management of invasive pests and diseases. Invasive species are an important issue to the department as California agricultural losses to exotic pests exceed $3 billionannually.
