**Non-Statistical Indicator**

## Relevant Policies

The California State Legislature adopted the [Public Records Act (CPRA)](https://www.cacities.org/Resources/Open-Government/THE-PEOPLE%E2%80%99S-BUSINESS-A-Guide-to-the-California-Pu.aspx) in 1968. It is designed to give the public access to information in the possession of public agencies. The Act also provides that public records shall be open for inspection during regular office hours of the agency. The public can inspect or receive a copy of any record unless the record is exempted from disclosure under the act.
Who can initiate a Public Records request? Anyone may initiate a request for public records.
The California Public Records Act requires an Agency to provide a response to the public records request within 10 calendar days. 
Public Record requests from the Office of the City Clerk may include a wide variety of documents and other materials (including print, photographic, and electronic formats) that were created or obtained by the department and are, at the time the request is filed, in the department's possession and control. The Public Records Act excludes certain categories of records from disclosure.
