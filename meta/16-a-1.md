## Relevant Policies

In 2019, [Ordinance 186084](http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2018/18-0086_ORD_186084_06-09-2019.pdf) added Article 16 to Chapter IV of the Los Angeles Municipal Code establishing the Los Angeles Civil and Human Rights Ordinance. This ordinance tasks the Civil and Human Rights Commission and its Executive Director to investigate complaints of discrimination and enforce against violators. By holding businesses and individuals accountable for discriminatory behavior, the City will make clear that discrimination will not be tolerated.

In 2020, Mayor Eric Garcetti has [nominated attorney Capri Maddox](https://www.lamayor.org/mayor-garcetti-nominates-capri-maddox-lead-los-angeles-department-civil-and-human-rights) to be the first Executive Director of the newly-established Los Angeles Department of Civil and Human Rights (CHRD).

The department will be tasked with protecting Angelenos — and anyone who works in or visits the City of Los Angeles — from discrimination that denies equal treatment in private employment, housing, education, or commerce by initiating and investigating complaints of discrimination, as well as enforcing the L.A. Civil and Human Rights Ordinance. The appointment is subject to City Council confirmation.
