The City of Los Angeles is the first city in the world to report the SDG indicators at the local level using [Open SDG](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (an open source SDG reporting platform originally developed for national level reporting by the United States and United Kingdom national governments). The City of Los Angeles has adapted the platform to the local level and documented all the changes in a [public wiki](https://github.com/dawncomer/open-sdg-site-starter/wiki) for other cities to use as a resource.
