**Revised indicator:** Revised to the local level from the original text: "Number of countries that have national statistical legislation that complies with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics."


**Non-Statistical Indicator**

Although the City of Los Angeles does not have a City statistical plan, Mayor Eric Garcetti issued [Executive Directive 3](https://www.lamayor.org/sites/g/files/wph446/f/page/file/Executive-Directive-3-Open-Data.pdf?1426620075) in 2013 to promote greater transparancy and accountability through open data. Various City departments collect and publish data to the [City's Open Data Portal](https://data.lacity.org/). Information about the City is also collected and disseminated by State and federal agencies including the U.S. Census Bureau.
