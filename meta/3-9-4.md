  The Los Angeles County Health Survey is a population based telephone survey
  that provides information concerning the health of Los Angeles County
  residents. The data are used for assessing health-related needs of the
  population, for program planning and policy development, and for program
  evaluation. The relatively large sample size allows users to obtain health
  indicator data for large demographic subgroups and across geographic regions
  of the County, including Service Planning Areas and Health Districts.
