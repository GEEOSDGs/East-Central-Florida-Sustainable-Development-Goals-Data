## Relevant Policies

At the national level, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) administers the [Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP)](https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/whatwedo/phep.htm) program to provide vital resources to ensure communities can effectively respond to infectious disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear events. At the state level, the [Emergency Preparedness Office of the California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/EPO/Pages/Program-Landing1.aspx) coordinates overall emergency planning operations for local health departments for disaster planning. The PHEP is coordinated by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH). In 2017, LACDPH received [$19,556,036 in PHEP funding](https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/pubs-links/2018/documents/LAC2018.pdf) in PHEP funding to respond to large-scale public health emergencies (e.g. earthquakes, environmental contamination, and extreme weather).
