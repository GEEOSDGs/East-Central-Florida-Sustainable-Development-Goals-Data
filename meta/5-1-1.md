## Relevant Policies

Extensive policies exist in California to enforce and monitor equality and non‐discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression. Under California law, the the 1949 [California Equal Pay Act](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/California_Equal_Pay_Act.htm) and the 1959 [California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA)](https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/employment/) make it illegal for an employer to discriminate based on gender. In 2017, a new regulation was approved under FEHA and requires employers to take transgender identity and expression into consideration. At the national level, [Title VII of the Civil Rights Act](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm) of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion.
