**Revised indicator:** All instances of “men and women” is revised to people and all instances of “boys and girls” is revised to “all children”. This indicator has been revised for inclusivity and revised to the local context from the original text: “Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education.”

**Non-Statistical Indicator**

## Relevant Policies

California law [SB-1301](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200120020SB1301) ensures that the state does not interfere with a woman’s fundamental right to choose. Barriers to reproductive care are removed through laws such [AB1954](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1954)(Health care coverage: reproductive health care services) and [AB775](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB775) (California Reproductive FACT Act) which require health care and pregnancy centers to disseminate knowledge about California’s programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services, prenatal care, and abortion, for eligible women. To maintain comprehensive knowledge about sexual health and wellbeing, California mandates sex education in its schools including HIV/AIDS prevention through the [California Healthy Youth Act]( https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/se/) (California Education Code (EC) sections 51930–51939).
