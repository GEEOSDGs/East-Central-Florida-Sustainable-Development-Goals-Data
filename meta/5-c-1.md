## Relevant Policies

In 2000, the City of Los Angeles passed a [local ordinance](https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2000/00-0398-S2_ORD_175735_02-08-2004.pdf) adopting the international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) - which mandates adoptees to ensure equality for women and girls in the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural arenas. 
In 2015, Mayor Eric Garcetti signed into order [Executive Directive 11](https://www.lamayor.org/sites/g/files/wph446/f/page/file/ED_11.pdf?1440645063), calling on every City Department to help Los Angeles fulfill its responsibilities under the CEDAW ordinance. As one of the first cities to adopt CEDAW, L.A. served as a model for its implementation by creating the Gender Equity Coalition — which includes a Gender Equity Liaison from every City Department — and directing the leadership of each Department to prepare a Gender Equity Action Plan, complete with quarterly plan progress reports, to measure and address disparities in the workforce.
