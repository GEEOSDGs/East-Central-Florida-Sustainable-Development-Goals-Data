computation_definitions: >-
  Disconnected youth is calculated as the proportion of youths aged 16-24 who
  are not enrolled in school or currently employed. Not enrolled in school is
  defined as not having attended school in the last 3 months. Not currently
  employed is defined as unemployed or not in labor force. Youth in the armed
  forces are not counted as being not employed. The Geographical area covers all
  Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) that are within the boundaries of Los
  Angeles County. This may undercount youths that are in PUMAs that are
  partially within County boundaries.
