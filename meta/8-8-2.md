## Relevant Policies

California has some of the most stringent labor laws in the United States. This includes a [$12 minimum wage](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm) ([$15 in the City of Los Angeles](https://www.lamayor.org/statement-mayor-garcetti-minimum-wage-increase)), overtime pay laws, vacation laws, and protections for independent contractors. The [Labor Commissioner's Office](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/) in the State of California Department of Industrial Relations is responsible for ensuring a just day's pay in every workplace in the State and to promote economic justice through robust enforcement of labor laws.
